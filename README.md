# Travel Destinations

A simple app to keep track of destinations I'd like to visit.  
This project was used as coursework for a Udacity Programming for 
Data Science Nano Degree and was a first pass attempt at
creating a remote repo on my Github account.

The repo is an example of my first work with git and bash,
pushing changes from my local machine to this repo.  As such
the code is more a proof of concept than code that actually
serves any functional purpose.
